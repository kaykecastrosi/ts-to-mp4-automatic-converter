# Why I created this project?
I needed to download Transport Stream videos into my computer and wanted to convert all of them to mp4. <br/>
There was so much files with too much subdirectories, and then i decided to create an algorithm to automatize the process.

# How it works:
It uses glob to find all the paths to the .ts files, convert each file into .mp4 and finally delete the old .ts file.
 
# Requirements:
- Have ffmpeg installed on your computer

# How to use?
- Drag the folder with the .ts files into the src folder
- Run the command:

```
npm start
```

### It's done!
